## üöÄ About This Project

This repository contains a beautiful, single-page digital wedding invitation for **Rakshit & Seem**. It's designed to provide an elegant and modern experience for guests, complete with personalization, animations, and all the event details in one place.

The project is built with **pure, dependency-free Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3**. It demonstrates advanced CSS techniques for animation (keyframes, transforms), scroll-based animations (Intersection Observer), and DOM manipulation for personalization.

The invitation starts with a "splash" page that asks for the guest's name, which is then dynamically inserted into the invitation card for a personal touch.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Personalized Welcome:** Greets guests by name after they enter it on the initial screen.
* **Elegant, Royal Theme:** Uses a classic royal blue and gold color palette (`#272872`, `#FFD700`) with traditional script fonts (`Great Vibes`, `EB Garamond`).
* **Multi-Page Feel (Single Page):** A fade transition moves from the name input screen to the main invitation card.
* **Advanced CSS Animations:**
    * **Floating Particles:** A subtle, looping particle animation in the background.
    * **Shimmering Gradient:** The main card background has a slow, shimmering gradient animation.
    * **Character Reveal:** The couple's names animate in, letter by letter.
    * **SVG Line Drawing:** The section dividers "draw" themselves as the user scrolls.
* **Scroll-Based Animations:** Content sections (like event details, photos) gracefully fade in and slide up as they enter the viewport using the **Intersection Observer API**.
* **Fully Responsive:** The design is optimized for both mobile phones and desktop browsers.
* **Self-Contained:** The entire application is a single `index.html` file, making it extremely lightweight, portable, and easy to deploy.

## üß∞ Getting Started

To customize this invitation for your own use, follow these steps.

### üìã Prerequisites

* A code editor (like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
* A web browser.
* (Optional) [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for version control.
* (Optional) [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for using `live-server`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Customize

1.  **Clone the Repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/suyogsontakke/Wedding-Invitation.git
    ```
    ```bash
    cd Wedding-Invitation
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`:** All the content is in this one file.
3.  **Replace Images:**
    * **Couple Photo:** Find the `.couple-photo` CSS rule and replace the `background-image: url(...)` with a URL to your photo.
    * **Emblem/Icon:** Replace the `favicon` links and the `<img>` tag for the `.buddha-icon` with your own icon URLs.
4.  **Edit Event Details (HTML):**
    * Change the names `Rakshit` and `Seem`.
    * Update the `p` tags with the correct parents' names and family details.
    * Update the `<h2>` and `<p>` tags inside each `.event-section` with your event (e.g., Haldi, Wedding, Reception), dates, times, and venue addresses.
    * Update the "With Best Compliments From" section.
5.  **Adjust Fonts & Colors (CSS):**
    * All colors are defined in the `:root` section at the top of the `<style>` tag. You can change `--bg-blue-dark`, `--gold-text`, etc., to match your theme.
    * Fonts are imported from Google Fonts in the `<head>`. You can change these, but be sure to update the `font-family` rules in the CSS.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Locally

* **Simple Method:** Just double-click the `index.html` file to open it directly in your web browser.
* **Recommended Method (using a local server):**
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the project directory
    npx live-server
    # OR if installed globally:
    # live-server
    ```
    This opens the site on a local URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).
